# Aaron Bassett

I am a Principal Software Engineer with over two decades of experience in Web2 and Web3. Over the last ten years, I've dedicated myself to developer relations, where I have excelled in creating interesting product use cases and highly technical resources. Adept in various languages, frameworks, and SDKs, I can conceive, develop, and execute compelling educational content that resonates with developers across diverse ecosystems.

My work is marked by a rare combination of technical depth, creativity, and empathetic communication. I craft engaging, developer-focused materials—from interactive workshops to technical guides—that makes complex topics accessible and actionable. My approach combines hands-on experience with a deep understanding of current and emerging technologies, allowing me to bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and practical applications.

My passion for knowledge sharing has led me to become a prominent figure in the developer community. I'm a regular keynote speaker and workshop presenter, frequently appearing at Web2 and Web3 conferences. As an alumnus of the [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.academy/pba-campus/) and a Smart Contract instructor [at UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTENSTYZmyo), I've been at the forefront of decentralized technology education.

Whether crafting code, delivering a keynote, mentoring at a workshop, or leading a hackathon, my goal remains consistent: to inspire, educate, and empower developers.

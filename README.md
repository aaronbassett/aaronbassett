For the last ten years, I've focused on developer relations, where I've thrived in crafting compelling product use cases and educational content that resonate with diverse audiences. My passion for sharing knowledge has led me to become a regular keynote speaker, an educator, a workshop presenter, and a mentor who enjoys guiding the next generation of developers.
